1. Decide on the name of your package. Standard debian notation is all lowercase in the following format:
    <project>_<major version>.<minor version>-<package revision>
For example, you could name your first package...
    mobydroid_0.2-1

2. Create a directory to make your package in. The name should be the same as the package name.
    mkdir mobydroid_0.2-1

3. Pretend that the packaging directory is actually the root of the file system. Put the files of your program where they would be installed to on a system.
    mkdir mobydroid_0.2-1/usr
    mkdir mobydroid_0.2-1/usr/local
    mkdir mobydroid_0.2-1/usr/local/bin
    cp "~/Projects/MobyDroid" mobydroid_0.2-1/usr/local/bin

4. Now create a special metadata file with which the package manager will install your program...
    mkdir mobydroid_0.2-1/DEBIAN
    gedit mobydroid_0.2-1/DEBIAN/control

5. Put something like this in that file...
    Package: mobydroid
    Version: 0.2-1
    Section: base
    Priority: optional
    Architecture: all
    Depends: libsomethingorrather (>= 1.2.13), anotherDependency (>= 1.2.6)
    Maintainer: Your Name <you@email.com>
    Homepage: http://foo.com
    Description: MobyDroid
     When you need some sunshine, just run this
     small program!
     
     (the space before each line in the description is important)

6. Now you just need to make the package:
    dpkg-deb --build mobydroid_0.2-1
